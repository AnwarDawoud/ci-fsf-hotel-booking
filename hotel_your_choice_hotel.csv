4,Great Southern Killarney,"From its distinctive architecture to its effortless service and genuine hospitality, Great Southern Killarney has been a favourite retreat for over 160 years.

After warming yourself by the open fire in our entrance hall, ease into a soft velvet sofa and enjoy afternoon tea. We like to think time slows down just a little at Great Southern Killarney. Enjoy the light as it streams through tall windows, ramble through our gardens, and rest for a while on a secluded bench. Where else are you going to find 6 acres of gardens in the centre of a bustling town? This is life at Great Southern Killarney, a Victorian landmark, and one of Ireland’s most beautiful hotels since 1854.
